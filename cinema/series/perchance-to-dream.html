          <h2>Healing all your past and present wounds</h2>

          <p>
            Would you agree to a comfortable life where you enjoy everything you have ever wanted?
            Your past traumas would be healed. That is the question posed by this episode of
            <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Batman wakes up and finds that his parents are alive, a major relief from his deepest trauma.
            He is about to marry Selina Kyle, and someone else has taken on the role of Batman, protecting
            Gotham City from crime.
          </p>

          <p>
            It sounds like a sweet deal, right? Life would be far less stressful. The episode reflects about
            identity through Bruce’s growing unease. He begins to search for the fake Batman, and in doing so,
            the episode asks an essential question: are we willing to give up our identity in exchange for
            having our desires fulfilled? I believe the answer should be no.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Mad Hatter even quotes <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>: “Are you the dreamer, or merely part of
            someone else’s dream?” a question Tweedledee asks Alice. When you give up your reality, you stop
            being the dreamer and become controlled by someone else. Our identity is shaped by all of our
            experiences, whether they are good or bad. Historical processes themselves are full of conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this episode, the evil nature and cruelty of the Mad Hatter are deeply frightening. One clever
            detail of the story is that the Mad Hatter sheds a tear when Batman finally escapes from his perfect
            dream. His lack of accountability is what motivates him to carry out this atrocious manipulation.
            He yells at Batman, telling him that Batman ruined his life. The Mad Hatter even justifies his
            actions by claiming that he gave Batman everything he ever wanted in exchange for being left alone.
          </p>

            To close my first post, I would like to recall Viktor Frankl’s words:
            “Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we
            respond to it.”
